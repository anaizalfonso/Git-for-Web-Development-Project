## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? it is a free and open source distributed version control system that handles small or large projects.it looks at data in snapshots everytime you commit.it works fast and efficient.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?git is the system that lets you manage and keep track history. github is a cloud based hosting service that lets you manage git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? we create a branch to as a pointer to a snapshot of the changes made.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?it helps the changes made in your local computer that was pushed ,  get uploaded(pulled) into the cloud system(github) and share with others.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
you would enter : cd -
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?git fetch- tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository
git pull=brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository.
git merge=it lets you combine several results of the commits into a single history.
7. What is a merge conflict?when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
in happens when there is more than one user (work environment).
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
open it and make the changes,after editing then use git add a command to stage the new merged content, and then create a new commit . this will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.

just testing i can do this on my own.
