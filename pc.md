Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?it is a free and open source distributed version control system that handles small or large projects.it looks at data in snapshots everytime you commit.it works fast and efficient.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? we would us a command " cd -" and that would take us back or git branch.
7. What is a merge conflict?when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other. in happens when there is more than one user (work environment).
